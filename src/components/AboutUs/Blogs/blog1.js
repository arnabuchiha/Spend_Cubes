                    <p>Frost & Sullivanâ€™s recent prediction in Post-Pandemic Global Healthcare Market Outlook, 2020 will be an
                         unforgiving but transformational year for the healthcare industry. As the world grapples with a global
                          emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare industry is expected to witness a drop in 
                          growth from 5.3% to 0.6% in 2020, with revenues remaining below the $2 trillion mark.</p>
                    <p>Elective procedures being on hold and delayed or prolonged procurement of capital equipment will have a
                         negative impact on revenue, from $413.9 billion to $377.1 billion for medical devices and from $31.5 
                         billion to $18.1 billion for imaging equipment.</p>
                    <p>While pharma companies may have little or no impact on revenues, hospitals, urgent care facilities, 
                        medical equipment manufacturers, imaging equipment manufacturers will bear the bulk of revenue drop.</p>
                    <p>During these times, it is essential to control all leakages. Every dollar saved can help in keeping 
                        necessary jobs, innovate to keep ahead of the competition.</p>
