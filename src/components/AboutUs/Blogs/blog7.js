                <div className="container pt-5 pb-5">
                    <p>For Devices with a two-year Service Agreement, contract termination charges sometimes cost more than the monthly charges of remaining contract term. Early termination fee for all major carriers like Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and sprint are up to $350. Here we put a quick look on major carrier’s Early Termination Fees.</p>

                    <h6 className="pt-3">The outlook for an early out</h6>
                    <p>Within initial policy days of Contract (usually 14 or 30days) if someone wants to terminate the services and want to return the product then as per the return and exchange policy a restocking fee of $25 to $75 is charged which is similar for Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile and also depends on the original cost of the product. But once the initial days are over, they probably charge between $50 and $350 for terminating the contract before its term. The termination cost for advance devices (like Smartphones, Netbooks) are more than the standard devices.</p>

                    <h6 className="pt-3">Verizon Wireless</h6>
                    <p>In Nov 2014, Verizon introduced a new policy by increasing their early termination fee. According to the new policy, if contract term of purchased advanced device is on or after Nov 14, 2014, then early termination fee will be $350, which will decline by: $10 per month between 8-18 months, $20 per month between 19-23 months, and $60 for the final month of contract term. For standard devices whose contract term starts from or after Nov 14, 2014, an Early Termination Fee will be charged as $175, which will decline by: $5 per month between 8-18 months, $10 per month between 19-23 months, and $30 for the final month of contract term.</p>
                    <p>So, as per the new policy, if you are paying less than $30 monthly charge for an advance device and less than $15 for a standard device and you  wants to terminate the contract after completion of 16 months then pre termination will be costlier then the monthly charges for the remaining contract term.</p>

                    <h6 className="pt-3">AT&T</h6>
                    <p>The termination cost of an AT&T contract early is little less than Verizon’s. If you are using an advanced device it is $325, and for all other devices it is $150. AT&T also gives you a break for every month of the contract you completed before terminating. Terminating the contract for an advanced device will set you back $325 minus $10 for each full month of the contract you completed; non-advanced devices get a $4 discount for each full contract month before the termination.</p>
                    <p>So, if you are planning to end the contract before 21 months term for advance device with monthly charge less than $30 and standard device with monthly charge less than $15 it will give befit of saving. But it will costlier if you terminate the contract in between 21 to 24 months. So, It is suggested do not terminate any device in last 4 remaining months of contract period of 24 months if your monthly charge is $30 and $15 for advance and non-advanced devices respectively.</p>

                    <h6 className="pt-3">T-Mobile</h6>
                    <p>The T-Mobile calculate early termination fee with only factor of how much time left in contract. T-Mobile doesn’t distinguish between advanced devices and standard devices when calculating early termination fees.  Early termination fees range from $50 if you have one to three months left on your contract to $200 if you’re under still contract for six months or more. If you terminate your contract during the last month, you’ll pay either $50 or your monthly recurring charges, whichever is less.</p>
                    <p>T-Mobile gives you a 20-day window after starting the contract during which you can back out by only paying restocking fees which is $75 to restock netbooks and tablets, $50 for smartphones, and $25 for basic phones. In this 20-day window there are no early termination charges.</p>

                    <h6 className="pt-3">Sprint</h6>
                    <p>The termination policy of Sprint gives you a bit of a break on early termination fees based on how many months of your contract you have completed. The calculation of termination fee would be by taking the number of months that remain in your contract and multiplying it by $20 for an advanced device, and $10 for a standard device with a maximum fee of $350 and $200, the minimum fee is $100 and $50 respectively for advanced device and standard devices.</p>
                    <p>If your contract is brand new, Sprint allows you to up to 14 days to cancel it by paying $35 restocking fee with charges of any service you have used.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bottom line :</strong> If you have an advance device with monthly charge $50 or standard device with monthly charge $25 the termination fee will be costlier than monthly charge for remaining contract term in all major carriers. So if you are planning to terminate the line in contract period must compare the remaining months recurring charge with termination cost.</p>
